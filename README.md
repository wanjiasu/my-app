## Production-Ready Authentication & Dashboard features
This template comes with a pre-configured authentication system and a simple dashboard interface, allowing you to start building your application with user management features right away.

## Getting Started with This Template

To use this template for your own project:

1. Create a new repository using this template by following GitHub's [template repository guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
2. Clone your new repository and navigate to it: `cd your-project-name`
3. Update this README:
   - Change the project name in the first line
   - Remove this "Getting Started with This Template" section
4. Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed

Once completed, proceed to the [Setup](#setup) section below.

## Setup

### Installing Required Tools

#### 1. Poetry
Poetry is used to manage Python dependencies in the backend. Install Poetry by following the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

#### 2. Node.jsm, npm and pnpm
Ensure Node.js and npm are installed for running the frontend. Follow the [Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
After that install pnpm by running:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### 3. Docker
Docker is needed to run the project in a containerized environment. Follow the appropriate installation guide:

- [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Get Docker CE for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/)

#### 4. Docker Compose
Ensure `docker-compose` is installed. Refer to the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Setting Up Environment Variables

**Backend (`fastapi_backend/.env`):**
Copy the `.env.example` files to `.env` and update the variables with your own values.
   ```bash
   cd fastapi_backend && cp .env.example .env
   ```
1. You will only need to update the secret keys. You can use the following command to generate a new secret key:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
   ```
2. The DATABASE, MAIL, OPENAPI, CORS, and FRONTEND_URL settings are ready to use locally.
3. You can check the .env.example file for more information about the variables.

**Frontend (`nextjs-frontend/.env.local`):**
Copy the `.env.example` files to `.env`. These values are unlikely to change, so you can leave them as they are.
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-frontend && cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Running the Database
1. Use Docker to run the database to avoid local installation issues. Build and start the database container:
   ```bash
   docker compose build db
   docker compose up db
   ```
2. Run the following command to apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   make docker-migrate-db
   ```

### Build the project (without Docker):
To setup the project environment locally, use the following commands:

#### Backend

1. Navigate to the `fastapi_backend` directory and run:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

#### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `nextjs-frontend` directory and run:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

### Build the project (with Docker):

1. Build the backend and frontend containers:
   ```bash
   make docker-build-backend
   make docker-build-frontend
   ```

## Running the Application

If you are not using Docker:

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   make start-backend
   ```

2. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   make start-frontend
   ```

If you are using Docker:
1. Start the FastAPI server container:
   ```bash
   make docker-up-backend
   ```
2. Start the Next.js development server container:
   ```bash
   make docker-up-frontend
   ```

- **Backend**: Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.
- **Frontend**: Access the web application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Hot Reload on development
The project includes two hot reloads when running the application, one for the backend and one for the frontend, which automatically restart local servers when they detect changes. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date without needing manual restarts.

- The **backend hot reload** monitors changes to the backend code.
- The **frontend hot reload** monitors changes to the frontend code, as well as to the `openapi.json` schema generated by the backend.

### Manual Execution of Hot Reload Commands
You can manually execute the same commands that the hot reloads call when they detect a change:

1. To export the `openapi.json` schema:
   ```bash
   cd fastapi_backend && poetry run python -m app.commands.generate_openapi_schema
   ```
   or using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm --no-deps -T backend poetry run python -m app.commands.generate_openapi_schema
   ```

2. To generate the frontend client:
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-frontend && npm run generate-client
   ```
   or using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm --no-deps -T frontend npm run generate-client
   ```

## Testing
To run the tests, you need to run the test database container:
   ```bash
   make docker-up-test-db
   ```

Then run the tests locally:
   ```bash
   make test-backend
   make test-frontend
   ```

Or using Docker:
   ```bash
   make docker-test-backend
   make docker-test-frontend
   ```
## Pre-Commit Setup
To maintain code quality and consistency, the project includes two separate pre-commit configuration files:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for running pre-commit checks locally.
- `.pre-commit-config.docker.yaml` for running pre-commit checks within Docker.

### Installing and Activating Pre-Commit Hooks
To activate pre-commit hooks, run the following commands for each configuration file:

- **For the local configuration file**:
  ```bash
  pre-commit install -c .pre-commit-config.yaml
  ```

- **For the Docker configuration file**:
  ```bash
  pre-commit install -c .pre-commit-config.docker.yaml
  ```

### Email Localhost Setup

To setup the email locally, you need to start [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) by running the following command:
   ```bash
   make docker-up-mailhog
   ```

- **Email client**: Access the email at `http://localhost:8025`.

### Running Pre-Commit Checks
To manually run the pre-commit checks on all files, use:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files -c .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

or

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files -c .pre-commit-config.docker.yaml
```

### Updating Pre-Commit Hooks
To update the hooks to their latest versions, run:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```
## Alembic Database Migrations
If you need to create a new Database Migration:
   ```bash
   make docker-db-schema migration_name="add users"
   ```
then apply the migration to the database:
   ```bash
   make docker-migrate-db
   ```

## GitHub Actions
This project comes with a pre-configured GitHub Actions setup to enable CI/CD. You can find the workflow configuration files inside the .github/workflows directory. Feel free to customize these workflows to better suit your project's needs.

### Secrets Configuration
For the workflows to function correctly, make sure to add the necessary secret keys to your GitHub repository's settings. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add the following keys:
```
DATABASE_URL: The connection string for your primary database.
TEST_DATABASE_URL: The connection string for your test database.
ACCESS_SECRET_KEY: The secret key for access token generation.
RESET_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY: The secret key for reset password functionality.
VERIFICATION_SECRET_KEY: The secret key for email or user verification.
```

## Production Deployment

### Overview

Deployment is streamlined through **Vercel**, with dedicated buttons for the **Frontend** and **Backend** applications. Both require specific configurations during and after deployment to ensure proper functionality.

---

### Frontend Deployment

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvintasoftware%2Fnextjs-fastapi-template%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fnextjs-frontend&env=API_BASE_URL&envDescription=The%20API_BASE_URL%20is%20the%20backend%20URL%20where%20the%20frontend%20sends%20requests.)

1. **Deploying the Frontend**  
   - Click the **Frontend** button above to start the deployment process.  
   - During deployment, you will be prompted to set the `API_BASE_URL`. Use a placeholder value (e.g., `http://`) for now, as this will be updated with the backend URL later.  
   - Complete the deployment process.

2. **Post-Deployment Configuration**  
   - Navigate to the **Settings** page of the deployed frontend project.  
   - Access the **Environment Variables** section.  
   - Update the `API_BASE_URL` variable with the backend URL once the backend deployment is complete.

---

### Backend Deployment

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvintasoftware%2Fnextjs-fastapi-template%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Ffastapi_backend&env=CORS_ORIGINS,TEST_DATABASE_URL,DATABASE_URL,ACCESS_SECRET_KEY,RESET_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY,VERIFICATION_SECRET_KEY)

1. **Deploying the Backend**  
   - Click the **Backend** button above to begin deployment.  
   - During the deployment process, you will be prompted to configure the following environment variables:

     - **CORS_ORIGINS**  
       - Set this to `["*"]` initially to allow all origins. You will update this with the frontend URL later.

     - **DATABASE_URL**  
       - Use a placeholder value (e.g., `https://`) if you don't yet have the actual database URL. Replace it with the correct URL post-deployment.

     - **ACCESS_SECRET_KEY**, **RESET_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY**, **VERIFICATION_SECRET_KEY**  
       - You can temporarily set these secret keys as plain strings (e.g., `examplekey`) during deployment. However, you should generate secure keys and update them after the deployment in the **Post-Deployment Configuration** section.

   - Complete the deployment process.

2. **Post-Deployment Configuration**  
   - Access the **Settings** page of the deployed backend project.  
   - Navigate to the **Environment Variables** section and update the following variables with secure values:

     - **CORS_ORIGINS**  
       - Once the frontend is deployed, replace `["*"]` with the actual frontend URL.

     - **DATABASE_URL**  
       - Update this with the actual database URL if not set during deployment.

     - **ACCESS_SECRET_KEY**  
       - Generate a secure key for API access and set it here.  

     - **RESET_PASSWORD_SECRET_KEY**  
       - Generate a secure key for password reset functionality and set it.

     - **VERIFICATION_SECRET_KEY**  
       - Generate a secure key for user verification and configure it.

   - For detailed instructions on how to set these secret keys, refer to the section on [Setting up Environment Variables](#setting-up-environment-variables).

3. **Database Connection**

   1. **Choosing a Database**
      - You can use your own database hosted on a different service or opt for the [Neon](https://neon.tech/docs/introduction) database, which integrates seamlessly with Vercel.

   2. **Setting Up a Neon Database via Vercel**
      - In the **Backend** project page on Vercel, navigate to the **Storage** section.  
      - Select the option to **Create a Database** to provision a Neon database.

   3. **Configuring the Database URL**
      - After creating the database, retrieve the **Database URL** provided by Neon.  
      - Include this URL in your **Environment Variables** under `DATABASE_URL`.  
      - Replace `postgres` with `postgres+asyncpg` at the start of the URL to ensure compatibility with asynchronous database operations.

   4. **Migrating the Database**
      - Once the database URL is configured, run your database migration script. This step is essential for creating the necessary tables and initializing your database schema.


## Makefile

This project includes a `Makefile` that provides a set of commands to simplify common tasks such as starting the backend and frontend servers, running tests, building Docker containers, and more.

### Available Commands

You can see all available commands and their descriptions by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make help
```

## Important Considerations
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env` files are up-to-date.
- **Database Setup**: It is recommended to use Docker for running the database, even when running the backend and frontend locally, to simplify configuration and avoid potential conflicts.
- **Consistency**: It is **not recommended** to switch between running the project locally and using Docker, as this may cause permission issues or unexpected problems. Choose one method and stick with it.
